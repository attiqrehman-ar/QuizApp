A simple and interactive quiz application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The app features a clean layout, engaging quiz questions, and a countdown timer of 15 seconds for each question.

## Features

- **Dynamic Timer:** Each question comes with a 15-second countdown, adding a sense of urgency and fun.
- **Interactive UI:** User-friendly interface with a polished and minimalistic design.
- **Score Tracking:** Keeps track of the user's score and displays it at the end of the quiz.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for various screen sizes to ensure a seamless experience across devices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the content of the application.
- **CSS**: For styling the layout and enhancing visual appeal.
- **JavaScript**: For quiz functionality, timer logic, and interactivity.

## How It Works

1. Start the quiz by clicking the "Start" button.
2. A question will appear with multiple-choice answers.
3. Select the correct answer before the timer (15 seconds) runs out.
